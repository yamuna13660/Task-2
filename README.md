ðŸ“Œ Task-2: Contact & To-Do List App
ðŸ§¾ Description
This project is a simple and responsive Contact Form & To-Do List Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It combines two essential features into one interface:

ðŸ“© A Contact Us form where users can enter their name, email, and a message.

âœ… A To-Do List where users can add and delete tasks dynamically.

The design is responsive, user-friendly, and styled with CSS. The functionality is powered entirely through vanilla JavaScript (no libraries or frameworks).
